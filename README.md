# Titanic_survivor_prediction
The root data is here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data 
a. The issue at hand is to predict survivors on the test data - after having trained the models using the training data. 
b. The problem is a classification problem - to predict whether has survived or not 
c. The following algorithms are trained against the training data: 1. Two-Class Averaged Perceptron 2. Two-Class Bayes Point Machine 3. Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree 4. Two-Class Decision Forest 5. Two-Class Decision Jungle 6. Two-Class Locally Deep Support Vector Machine 7. Two-Class Logistic Regression 8. Two-Class Neural Network 9. Two-Class Support Vector Machine 
d. Out of all these - the top three were found to be the Neural Network followed by the Averaged Perceptron and the Bayes Point Machine
